# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using RNN

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model to classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It utilizes deep learning techniques to process natural language data and extract sentiment.

---

## 📌 Features

- Binary sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)
- Preprocessing and tokenization of raw text data
- RNN-based architecture (with LSTM/GRU optionally)
- Trained on IMDB or custom movie review dataset
- Accuracy evaluation on test data
- Interactive prediction for user input review

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Embedding Layer
- Recurrent Layer (Simple RNN / LSTM / GRU)
- Dense Output Layer (Sigmoid for binary classification)

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source**: IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset (or custom)
- **Size**: 50,000 reviews (25k train / 25k test)
- **Format**: Text files or CSV with review and sentiment
